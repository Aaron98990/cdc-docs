# SAP CDC Documentation

This documentation is meant to supplement [SAP's CDC Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_CUSTOMER_DATA_CLOUD/GIGYA/en-US), not replace it. Many times SAP Documentation is incomplete, inaccurate, obsolete, and not beginer friendly. The code samples are very limited and troubleshooting errors is a pain in the assRhis documentation is looking to fill the void SAP's documentation leaves by leaning on each other.
