# Capgemini's SAP CDC Documentation

This documentation is meant to supplement [SAP's CDC Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_CUSTOMER_DATA_CLOUD/GIGYA/en-US), not replace it. Many times SAP Documentation is incomplete, inaccurate, obsolete, and not beginer friendly. The code samples are very limited and troubleshooting errors is a pain in the ass. With Capgemini's expertise with working with dozens of clients on CDC and over 50 employees dedicated to the subject, this documentation is looking to fill the void SAP's documentation leaves by leaning on each other.
