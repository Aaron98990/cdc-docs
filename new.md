SAP Customer Data Cloud (CDC) can be overwhelming to start with esspecially with no support.

## History of SAP and CDC

SAP sells enterprise application software or software for businesses.

CDC was formerly called GIGYA before it was aquired by SAP for an estimated [$350 million in 2017](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/24/sap-is-buying-identity-management-firm-gigya-for-350m/). You may see documentation or links with GIGYA and sometimes hear people call CDC, GIGYA because of this.


For now, everything shown in CDC is B2C (Business to Consumer) rather than B2B (Business to Business).
CDC (Customer Data Cloud) includes ECPM (Enterprise Consent and Preference Management) and CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management)


Please note, CDP (Customer Data Platform) is a different product to CDC (Customer Data Cloud).
CDP and CDC fall into the CDS (Customer Data Solutions). Also, CDS is sometimes called CDx (since CDC and CDP start with CD).
SAP CX (Customer Experience) was formerly called SAP C/4HANA. Do not confuse SAP C/4HANA with SAP S/4HANA.

SAP CX includes: 
- Customer Data Solutions
- Commerce Solutions
- Marketing Solutions
- Sales Solutions
- Service Solutions

## Steps you should take?

First, please ask for access from your manager to a CDC tenant. If you cannot log into the [CDC Console](https://console.gigya.com) do not continue as the best way to learn CDC is by doing not just reading or watching.

## Certification

[The SAP Certification Development Associate - SAP Customer Data Cloud (C_C4H620_94) Certification](https://www.sap.com/cxworks/article/2589632795/become_a_certified_sap_customer_data_cloud_consultant) is a great way to show your understanding of CDC. 

The exam consists of 80 multiple choice questions and requires a 58% score for passing with a duration of 180 min. Each question will tell you the number of correct answers (e.g. choose 3 answers) for the question. If you do not get all the answers for the question, you will recieve no credit for the question. The exam is done remotely (e.g. home) with a proctor through a Zoom call. You will recieve your score immediatly after the exam and your score per category but will not be able to review any questions after the exam.

In case an exam is not passed on the first try, you can take the same exam up to three times. If you have failed an exam three times for the same version, you will have to wait until a new version is released.
